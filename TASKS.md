## We will start by fixing and adding the functionality of minimum features.

For now we're mostly just focusing on base functionality
We should be working with separate files most of the time, so our commits shouldn't conflict really.

## FRONT END
* Fix profile page for normal user -> Attallah
* Make profile page for admin user (just make admin roles able to see it) -> Mahmoud
* Make and set up a styled homepage -> Omar
* Pick a color scheme and overall style -> Omar

Please finish by Sunday 8/3/2020
