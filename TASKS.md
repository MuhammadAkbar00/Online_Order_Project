## We will start by fixing and adding the functionality of minimum features.

For now we're mostly just focusing on base functionality
We should be working with separate files most of the time, so our commits shouldn't conflict really.

## FRONT END
* ~~Fix profile page for normal user -> Attallah~~
* ~~Make profile page for admin user (just make admin roles able to see it) -> Mahmoud~~
* ~~Make and set up a styled homepage -> Omar (Footer remaining)~~
* ~~Pick a color scheme and overall style -> Omar (Need help in that, I might as well be color blind)~~
**We will change the color scheme later, but the structure is sound so far**

* Implement a marketing page, build an isolated component (the return body and data fetch) -> Attallah
  * Linking the component in another page is done by someone else.
  * Make a new folder like user and public, but name it Sales or Marketing, something that fits the role
* Implement an order page component, isolated as well, please do not edit existing files unless necessary. When you're building the component do your fetch and everything from within it. -> Mahmou
* Implement a "find nearest branch" component page. Should include google maps api. -> Omar

**When you're making isolated components and you wanna test them, it's fine if you change other files, but once you know they work, please remove the testing from the other files. The idea of isolated components is that I can simply put the name of your component in a page and it just loads there ... Agile development and all that shit.**


**Please finish by Wednesday 11/3/2020**
